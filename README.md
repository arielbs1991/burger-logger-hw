## Description

    We used express, express-handlebars, and mysql to build and link together a website in which a user can enter a burger description which is saved in a mysql database. The created burgers persist, and can be modified from devoured === true to devoured === false and back, as well as deleted. We deployed the app using heroku and JAWSDB.

## Installation

    No steps to install, just visit https://thawing-crag-34629.herokuapp.com and play away!

## Usage 

    This webpage allows you to enter in a description of a burger, which sends it into a list of burgers titled "Ready to Eat!". From there you can click a button that says "EATIN' TIME!" to move the burger into the "Oh Man, Was That Good" column, from whence you can either "MAKE IT AGAIN!" or "Remove!" it.
